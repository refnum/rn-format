rn-format
=========
rn-format is a source code reformatter based on uncrustify and clang-format.

Uncrustify is used to perform code transformations, such as adjusting
parentheses or braces, followed by clang-format for code reformatting.

A final set of formatting rules are then applied after both tools.

It is distributed under the MIT licence.
